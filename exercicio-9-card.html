      <p class="card-text">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; opacity: 0.8;">I was an EMT for over 3 years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I had to see what it was about. First week wasn't easy – I was struck with imposter syndrome – I didn't belong there. But within a few weeks, I started believing in myself more than I probably ever did. I finally feel like I belong as a developer!</p>

      <p class="card-text">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; opacity: 0.8;">I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mid-level developer for an awesome web company. They really invested in my journey as a developer when they brought me on as an apprentice and I feel like I've had genuine "on the job" experience. Incredible experience!</p>

      <p class="card-text">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.85rem;">Before joining the bootcamp, I've never done anything with code. I've been thinking about doing something like this for a few years but kept freezing up, not knowing where to start. Finally took the jump and signed up for the bootcamp a year ago. Doing the whole thing, working part-time and studying, was definitely intense but so worth it. Every single level up in my learning journey was celebrated and felt so supported by everyone. Thank you!</p>

      <p style="font-size: 0.85rem;">Thank you for your excellent tuition and support throughout the bootcamp. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience. It's truly enriched my understanding of web development and I look forward to applying these skills professionally. Thank you!</p>

      <p class="card-text">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 0.85rem; opacity: 0.8;">The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I feel is a big deal in a corporate fSetting. They're very invested in helping you succeed. You'll get as much details as you can possibly want about how to improve, but in a way it feels supportive and inclusive. You won't get this experience everywhere and definately not to this level. glad to be a part of such a fun and welcoming community :) getting guidance from William and other students/helper have really helped. Thank you for the excellent teaching support, from a very caring team with a high level of excellence that can be hard to find nowadays. might as well have a fun time!!</p>
